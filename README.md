This project will use html5 and css (with media queries); it will NOT use javascript.

Create a responsive web page using the grid and/or flexbox models. It should operate as the demo shown in class, i.e. support threeconfigurations based on page size:– 750px750px +1000px


There are 3 *.png files in the public directory that show basic layout at each size. Configuration should handle both arrangement inside thebordered container, as well as relative sizes of the components, as in the demo.

Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all files for the project.

p1 will be graded on www.cs.mtsu.edu in this manner:python3 -m http.server –cgi 5994 &amp; ## where 5994 is a port I choose

in chrome on another computer, visit:http://www.cs.mtsu.edu:5994

When I visit that URL, there should be a file there named p1.htmlwhich I will select to load into the browser.

This is the basic technique which we will use for almost all projects thissemester.
